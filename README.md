# NL
a silly little programming language

## what 
You know ML, the Meta Language? NL is a hobbyist's love letter
to that elegant functional programming language that inspired
many a student.

## the name though?
Consequently, NL could mean any number of things, such as
- Needs Love
- Neta Language (+1 compared to Meta Language...)
- Not Likely (to succeed?)

Take your pick or insert your own! (pull request)

## why
Just to write a program using pure C and no libraries except
for the standard library.

Maybe it'll be the scripting language for a computer game sometime, who knows!
